Let \\(A, B\\) be square (complex) matrices such that \\(\|B\| \le A\\). Then it is well known that \\(\rho(B) \le \rho(\|B\|) \le \rho(A)\\), where \\(\rho\\) denotes the [spectral radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_radius) (largest absolute value of all eigenvalues). In my research with [Brendan](https://www.brendanbeare.com/), we needed to use the spectral abscissa (largest real part of all eigenvalues) instead of the spectral radius. By analogy, we can make the following conjecture: if \\(A, B\\) are square complex matrices such that \\(\mathrm{Re} b_{nn} \le a_{nn}\\) for all \\(n\\) and \\(\|b_{nn'}\| \le a_{nn'}\\) for all \\(n \neq n'\\), then is it true that \\(\zeta(B) \le \zeta(A)\\), where \\(\zeta\\) denotes the spectral abscissa?

It turns out that the answer is yes. The main part of the proof uses the fact that \\(\zeta(B) \le \zeta(\tilde{B})\\), where
