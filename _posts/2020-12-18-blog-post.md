My paper "[Necessity of Hyperbolic Absolute Risk Aversion for the Concavity of Consumption Functions](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmateco.2020.102460)" 
was accepted at [Journal of Mathematical Economics](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-mathematical-economics). The publication process was 
quite efficient. I came up with the idea in late September 2020 and wrote a short paper. After getting rejected from a different journal, I sent to JME. 
I am very happy that it came out in less than three months after I have started the project. Journals in economics tend to be very slow in the review 
process, perhaps because many papers tend to be long and unfocused. We should all write concise and focused papers.

This paper marks my 30th published paper. I hope to maintain my productivity.
