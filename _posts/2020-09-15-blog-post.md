I have been using LaTeX for over 20 years now. When I write a displayed equation without numbering on a single line, I have been using `$$...$$` because it was simple. I didn't understand why some people use `\[...\]`, because the latter takes more time to type and is not necessarily easy to read. Today I read [this article](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/503/why-is-preferable-to) and learned that `$$...$$` is incorrect. From now on, I will switch to `\begin{equation*}...\end{equation*}` because it is easy to read and we can add equation numbering by deleting `*` if we change our mind.
