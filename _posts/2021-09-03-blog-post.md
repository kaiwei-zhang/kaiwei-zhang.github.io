My paper "[Perov's Contraction Principle and Dynamic Programming with Stochastic Discounting](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.orl.2021.09.001)" got accepted at Operations Research Letters. I found a generalization of Banach's contraction mapping theorem when I was studying a certain dynamic programming problem with stochstic discounting. It turned out that the theorem was due to Perov (1964) but I thought the application was interesting so I wrote a paper.
