I don't remember when I opened a [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/) account; I guess I did so to increase the visibility of my research. 
I don't really use their service, but I find it annoying that I get requests to upload full-text articles. This is a waste of time because most of my 
papers are available online as working paper versions. (These days I upload my working papers exclusively to [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/).) 
So I decided to write a short document stating that all of my papers are linked from my personal website (and provided the link), and uploaded it 
as a full-text article.
