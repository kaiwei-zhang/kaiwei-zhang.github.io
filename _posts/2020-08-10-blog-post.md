There is a restaurant called "[The Bistro](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-bistro-at-the-strand-la-jolla)" on UCSD campus. Although I don't like this restaurant because it's basically a fusion American Asian place, sometimes I have to eat there when we take seminar speakers for lunch. Once I ordered some fried cod (neither quite fish and chips nor tempura). On the menu it said the dish comes with brown rice, so I asked the server to substitute white rice for brown rice. (Most Japanese people eat white rice - only those with strong opinions eat brown rice, though obviously the latter is healthier.) When the dish arrived, I was stunned that the rice, though white, was sushi rice (i.e., vinegared rice). I asked the server to bring proper white rice but she didn't know the difference. Since then, whenever I organize the seminar lunch, I choose a different place.
