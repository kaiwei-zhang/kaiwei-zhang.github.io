These days I mostly play competitive tennis, so my opponents usually have sufficient understandings of the rules and we do not get into disputes. However, debates and disputes sometimes occur in recreational play, which could be annoying. So in a series of posts, let me talk about some rules that could be overlooked by recreational players. The official rules can be found in the "Friend at Court" [here](https://www.usta.com/en/home/coach-organize/tennis-tool-center/resource-library/bylaws-regulations-forms.html).

Can players talk during a point? This is covered in ITF Code 34:
> 34. *Talking when ball is in play.*
>- Singles players should not talk during points.
>- Talking between doubles partners when the ball is moving toward them
is allowed.
>- Doubles players should not talk when the ball is moving toward their
opponent's court.
>- Any talking that interferes with an opponent's ability to play a ball is a
hindrance.
