These days I mostly play competitive tennis, so my opponents usually have sufficient understandings of the rules and we do not get into disputes. However, debates and disputes sometimes occur in recreational play, which could be annoying. So in a series of posts, let me talk about some rules that could be overlooked by recreational players. The official rules can be found in the "Friend at Court" [here](https://www.usta.com/en/home/coach-organize/tennis-tool-center/resource-library/bylaws-regulations-forms.html).

Can players talk during a point? This is covered in ITF Code 34:
> 34. *Talking when ball is in play.* 
>- Singles players should not talk during points.
>- Talking between doubles partners when the ball is moving toward them
is allowed.
>- Doubles players should not talk when the ball is moving toward their
opponent's court.
>- Any talking that interferes with an opponent's ability to play a ball is a
hindrance.

Players should not talk during points in singles. So,
- You cannot say "Double bounce!" to the opponent. The opponent should admit double bounce; otherwise wait to complain until the point is over.
- You cannot scream "Yes!" after hitting a winner (until the ball bounces twice etc.) or "Sh\*t!" after committing a likely unforced error. I have seen players yelling after hitting a ball thinking it was going out, only to see the ball is good. These days I warn the player that that is a hindrance (which entitles me the point).
- You cannot say "Sorry" to the opponent (until the ball is out of play) even if you think you hit a smash into their body. This point is almost a joke, but it happend during the [Medvedev-Bublik match in Toronto Open 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9wobRpcqlE). Medvedev hit an overhead, which he thought hit the body of Bublik and said "sorry". But in fact the ball hit Bublik's racquet (not body), so the ball was still in play and Medvedev lost a point for hindrance.

In doubles, players can talk only when the ball is moving toward them. So you can say "You!", "Me!" to indicate who is going to take the ball, you cannot say "Nice shot!" (for partner's winner) or "Sh\*t!" (for your unforced error) until the ball is out of play.

Of course, grunting when you are hitting the ball hard is acceptable. But let's remember to be quiet during points.
