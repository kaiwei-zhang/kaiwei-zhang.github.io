I have created a new website. I have been using [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com) to create my old website. I like the classic Google Sites because it allows the user to take control of the structure by programming in html. However, the new Google Sites no longer have this feature, and since the classic Google Sites will be [discontinued in 2021](https://www.steegle.com/google-sites/classic-deprecation-timeline), I had to do something else. After a bit of Google search, I found [this template](https://academicpages.github.io/), which is exactly what I wanted (ability to take full control, free, no advertisements, etc.).

I haven't migrated all the contents from my old website yet, but will do so gradually.
