My university uses Canvas for instructional purposes. Canvas has a functionality called "Inbox", which allows you to send messages. I have long thought this functionality not only useless but even harmful. Since I was not able to find information on how to disable Inbox, I contacted the university technical support.

> Description: Hello, I am a faculty at the economics department. I would like to disable the Canvas Inbox functionality but could not find information on the web (or only very old information). The issue is that I told students that I do not monitor Canvas Inbox and any message sent there will be ignored, but nevertheless there are students who do not pay attention and still send me messages through Canvas Inbox. This is a serious issue because it could affect my teaching evaluation.
