I played the [San Diego District Championship](https://playtennis.usta.com/Competitions/san-diego-district-tennis-association/Tournaments/draws/C23369B8-B5EB-4DCC-98F6-ED8C8BF21752) NTRP 3.5 men's singles over the last two weekends, and I won the final 6-1, 6-7(5-7), 7-5.

During the second set tiebreak, when I was up 2-1 I got cramps on both legs and took a medical timeout. At one point I was leading 5-3 but lost four consecutive points and the set, which was quite disappointing. I thought about retiring but decided to go as far as I could. The third set was brutal, and to avoid using my legs too much, I played more aggressively by aiming for winners and taking the net to keep the points short. The third set reminded me of the famous [Chang-Lendl 1989 French Open match](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjko6Wp0evyAhXCGTQIHUc9Dy4QwqsBegQIAxAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZTPAUi0nFIs&usg=AOvVaw35QGToSG8B8NqxwIE-eZah), in which Chang was cramping. When I was receiving at 5-6 I stood closer to the service line to put pressure, and eventually the opponent committed an unforced error at match point. The match lasted 4.5 hours.

I hope this will bump me up to NTRP 4.0 rating. I have learned a lot from playing the tournament - I tend to play defensively but to win at the next level I need to be more aggressively.
