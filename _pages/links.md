[The World of Math Equations](https://eqworld.ipmnet.ru/).

A great hand book of causal inference in Python [Causal Inference for the Brave and True](https://github.com/matheusfacure/python-causality-handbook).

An open source book about Real Analysis, up to now is my favorite one [Measure, Integration & Real Analysis](https://measure.axler.net/MIRA.pdf).
