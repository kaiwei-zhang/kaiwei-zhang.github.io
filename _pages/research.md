I am an "applied general equilibrium theorist", meaning that I am a theorist interested in general equilibrium theory and its applications (typically in finance and macroeconomics). In addition to papers in mathematical economics and finance, I have written many papers on power law, which naturally emerges in dynamic general equilibrium models with heterogeneous agents. I have also written several papers on numerical methods (discretization of probability distributions and stochastic processes), which are useful for numerically solving models (see the discretization page). Below is the complete publication list.

1. "[On the Emergence of a Power Law in the Distribution of COVID-19 Cases](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physd.2020.132649)", with **Brendan K. Beare**, Physica D 412: 132649 (2020) [WP version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12772) [Code](https://github.com/alexisakira/COVID-19_power_law) [BibTeX](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pLppJbPuWKyqUeac97oge2ehCqKf3Yjf)  
(Power law, Empirical) The size distribution of COVID-19 cases across US counties obeys the power law, and the Pareto exponent is consistent with the estimated growth rate and age distributions.
1. "[The Income Fluctuation Problem and the Evolution of Wealth](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jet.2020.105003)", with **Qingyin Ma and John Stachurski**, Journal of Economic Theory 187: 105003 (2020) [WP version](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13045) [Code](https://github.com/jstac/ifp_public) [BibTeX](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eFVnWT2RHmcFnpJXeQBx2gWKxbGTpWoV)  
(Power law, Theory) Establish existence and uniqueness of a solution to a general income fluctuation problem and characterize tail behavior of stationary wealth distribution.
