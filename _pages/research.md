I am an "applied general equilibrium theorist", meaning that I am a theorist interested in general equilibrium theory and its applications (typically in finance and macroeconomics). In addition to papers in mathematical economics and finance, I have written many papers on [power law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law), which naturally emerges in dynamic general equilibrium models with heterogeneous agents. I have also written several papers on numerical methods (discretization of probability distributions and stochastic processes), which are useful for numerically solving models (see the [discretization page](/discretization/)). Below is the complete publication list.
