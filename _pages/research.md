I am an "applied general equilibrium theorist", meaning that I am a theorist interested in general equilibrium theory and its applications (typically in finance and macroeconomics). In addition to papers in mathematical economics and finance, I have written many papers on power law, which naturally emerges in dynamic general equilibrium models with heterogeneous agents. I have also written several papers on numerical methods (discretization of probability distributions and stochastic processes), which are useful for numerically solving models (see the discretization page). Below is the complete publication list.

## Refereed research articles (reverse chronological)

1. "[On the Emergence of a Power Law in the Distribution of COVID-19 Cases](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physd.2020.132649)", with **Brendan K. Beare**, *Physica D* 412: 132649 (2020) [WP version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12772) [Code](https://github.com/alexisakira/COVID-19_power_law) [BibTeX](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pLppJbPuWKyqUeac97oge2ehCqKf3Yjf)  
(Power law, Empirical) The size distribution of COVID-19 cases across US counties obeys the power law, and the Pareto exponent is consistent with the estimated growth rate and age distributions.
1. "[The Income Fluctuation Problem and the Evolution of Wealth](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jet.2020.105003)", with **Qingyin Ma and John Stachurski**, *Journal of Economic Theory* 187: 105003 (2020) [WP version](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13045) [Code](https://github.com/jstac/ifp_public) [BibTeX](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eFVnWT2RHmcFnpJXeQBx2gWKxbGTpWoV)  
(Power law, Theory) Establish existence and uniqueness of a solution to a general income fluctuation problem and characterize tail behavior of stationary wealth distribution. 
1. "[Data-based Automatic Discretization of Nonparametric Distributions](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10614-020-10012-6)", *Computational Economics* [WP version](http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00896)  
(Numerical method) Automatic discretization method of nonparametric distributions using Gaussian quadrature.
1. "[The Equity Premium and the One Percent](https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhz121)", with **Kieran James Walsh**, *Review of Financial Studies* 33(8): 3583-3623 (2020) [WP version](https://ssrn.com/abstract=2409969) [BibTeX](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ukr1ZNtNS7Riu7IqUIYlBLWSXyDQH8YY)  
(Finance, Theory, Empirical) In general equilibrium model with heterogeneous risk aversion and/or beliefs, the wealth distribution predicts excess stock returns, which we confirm in data using estate tax rate change as instrument.
1. "[Efficient Minimum Distance Estimation of Pareto Exponent from Top Income Shares](https://doi.org/10.1002/jae.2788)", with **Yulong Wang**, *Journal of Applied Econometrics* [WP version](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02471) [Code](http://qed.econ.queensu.ca/jae/datasets/toda002/)  
(Power law, Econometrics) How to efficiently estimate Pareto exponents when only certain top income shares are observable.
1. "[Is Gibrat's "Economic Inequality" Lognormal?](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00181-019-01719-z)", with **Sherzod Akhundjanov**, *Empirical Economics*  
(Power law, Empirical) The majority of data sets analyzed by Gibrat and claimed to be lognormal are actually closer to Pareto-type distributions.
1. "[Publications, Citations, Position, and Compensation of Economics Professors](https://econjwatch.org/articles/publications-citations-position-and-compensation-of-economics-professors)", with **Yifei Lyu**, *EconJournalWatch*, 16(2): 239-257 (2019) [Code](https://econjwatch.org/file_download/1115/LyuTodaSept2019DataAndCode.zip) [BibTeX](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xaPeMeZAJ4pDGDmZBamdxt0_NO4aRD3_)  
(Empirical) Publications (Top 5/Non-top 5) and job rank explains over 80% of variations in salaries among economics professors in the UC system. There is no evidence of gender gap.
