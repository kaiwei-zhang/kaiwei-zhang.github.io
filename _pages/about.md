I am currently a graduate student at the [Guanghua School of Management, Peking University](https://en.nsd.pku.edu.cn/](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/). Before that I graduate from [Yuanpei College, Peking University](https://yuanpei.pku.edu.cn/en/). I was born in [Pingyao, Shanxi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingyao) and speak Chinese and English.

## My research
I mainly work on applied microeconomic theory, with a particular interest in dynamic learning and tournament design. I'm also interested in behavior topics like loss aversion (especially with expectations-based reference points). 

I'm also trying to include information technology like [bandit algo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit) or [platform economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_economy) into my study. I have some research projects with respect to supervision problems in platform economy and ad-experiments in digital economy.

Looking to the future, I want to extend the research frontier of information economics in the context of digital platforms, both empirically and theoretically. Digital economy is fast-changing featuring in recent years the wide applications of artificial intelligence based on nano level data. It not only changed how service is provided but also generate new forms of human computer interactions, which challenges the applicability of classic economic theories about market, labor, and industrial organization. There are exciting new research questions including the principal-agent problem in the platform economy and the dynamic learning strategy under reinforcement learning algorithms, for example to evaluate the value of consumersâ€™ feedback since they act as a supervision role in platform economy, and so on. Some new technologies, such as blockchain technology, may even fundamentally change trust-building mechanism in microeconomic theory. I intend to put my effort into understanding such phenomena and building new theories.
