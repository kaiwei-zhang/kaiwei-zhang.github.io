I am an undergraduate student at the [National School of Development, Peking University](https://en.nsd.pku.edu.cn/). I was born in [Suizhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suizhou) and speak Chinese and English.

## My research
I am a mathematical economist with strong interests in applications. The topics I have worked on include

- [the impossibility of canonical macroeconomic models to explain wealth inequality](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jet.2019.04.001),
- [a simple explanation for the saving behavior of the rich that does not rely on ad hoc utility functions](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jet.2021.105193),
- [a computational algorithm for solving macroeconomic models with realistic wealth distributions](https://qeconomics.org/ojs/forth/1817/1817-2.pdf),
- [simple formula and mathematical foundation for Pareto exponents that arise in random multiplicative processes in Markovian environments](https://dx.doi.org/10.3982/ECTA17984),
- [verification of the random multiplicative process to explain the spread of COVID-19](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physd.2020.132649),
- [wealth inequality and stock market returns](https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhz121),
- [determination of academic salaries](https://econjwatch.org/articles/publications-citations-position-and-compensation-of-economics-professors),
- [implication of financial development to international capital flows and welfare](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfineco.2018.08.011),
- [efficient discretization of non-linear, non-Gaussian Markov processes](https://doi.org/10.3982/QE737),
- [optimal epidemic control when testing and government enforcement are imperfect](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jet.2022.105570),

among others.

I have published papers in journals such as [Econometrica](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14680262), [Journal of Political Economy](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/toc/jpe/current), [Theoretical Economics](https://econtheory.org/), [Quantitative Economics](http://qeconomics.org/ojs/index.php/qe), [Journal of Economic Theory](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-economic-theory), [Review of Financial Studies](https://academic.oup.com/rfs), [Journal of Financial Economics](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-financial-economics), [Journal of Monetary Economics](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-monetary-economics), [American Mathematical Monthly](https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/american-mathematical-monthly), [SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis](https://www.siam.org/publications/journals/siam-journal-on-numerical-analysis-sinum), [Operations Research Letters](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/operations-research-letters), and [Physical Review E](https://journals.aps.org/pre/), among others. I am also a medical doctor (anesthesiologist) and an associate editor at [Economic Theory](https://www.springer.com/journal/199) and [Journal of Mathematical Economics](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-mathematical-economics). Please see my [research page](/research/) for more details.

## My values
I find it beautiful when regularity and complexity come together. Some corollaries of this statement are:

- I like mathematics,
- I like power law behavior,
- My favorite composer is [J. S. Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach),
- My favorite artist is [M. C. Escher](https://mcescher.com/),
- I like short, simple papers that are to the point.

I also like programming, chess, and tennis, although I am not particularly good at those.

I believe in individual freedom. We are free to choose whatever we want, within the rules set by law and other social norms, as long as we respect other people's freedom. Freedom comes with responsibility. Whatever we choose to do (or not to do), we must accept the consequences.

In my professional life as a researcher, mentor, and teacher, I promise that I will evaluate others based solely on merit and nothing else. For example, if I write a referee report for a paper, your affiliation, authority, fame, or personal connection to me will play no role. If I evaluate your file for admission to graduate school, I will not read your diversity statement but yet will give you the highest mark for "diversity" if I have to select a mark. If I assign a grade or write a letter of recommendation, I will base my evaluation solely on your academic performance and promise. If I am involved with recruiting, I will be interested only in your scientific achievements and future prospect, and I will ignore everything else including your age, height, hair style, dietary preferences, skin color, ancestral heritage, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, number of children, political views, religious beliefs, among others.

## My Erdős number
My current [Erdős number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) is 3, based on the following connections (you can use [this tool](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/freeTools.html) to compute your Erdős number or the collaboration distance between anybody):
