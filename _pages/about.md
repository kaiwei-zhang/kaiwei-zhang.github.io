I am currently a Ph.D. student at [Economics Department, Penn State University](https://econ.la.psu.edu/). I graduate from [Yuanpei College, Peking University](https://yuanpei.pku.edu.cn/en/) and got a master's degree in [Guanghua School of Management, Peking University](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/). I was born in [Pingyao, Shanxi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingyao) and went to [Pingyao High school of Shanxi](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%B1%B1%E8%A5%BF%E7%9C%81%E5%B9%B3%E9%81%A5%E4%B8%AD%E5%AD%A6%E6%A0%A1/6439441).



## My Theory Research
My primary focus lies in applied microeconomic theory, where I delve into dynamic learning, mechanism design and tournament design. I find dynamic settings particularly engaging. I'm equally intrigued by behavioral aspects. One of my ongoing projects introduces Expectations-Based Loss Aversion into the realm of Subjective Tournament Design. For a more in-depth look, feel free to explore my working papers!

I also have some stopped projects about auctions and searches, outside of my main interests. What kind of projects I get involved in depends on the technical difficulty.

## My Empirical Research
To complement my theoretical pursuits, I integrate information technology elements such as the [bandit algo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit) and delve into the realm of [platform economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_economy) . Notably, my research projects encompass supervision challenges within the platform economy and experiments in the digital economy. At [JD.com’s Silicon Valley R&D Center]([https://www.jd.com/?country=USA](https://jdcorporateblog.com/jd-coms-silicon-valley-rd-center-ramps-up-operations/)), I served as an Algorithm Scientist Intern for two years. Here, I successfully developed a dynamic bandit system. This innovative system intelligently allocates user traffic to temporarily optimal materials, ensuring rapid convergence through continuous learning. Furthermore, I constructed a comprehensive causal analysis economic model, evaluating the effectiveness of the experimental platform. We also delved into the transferability of knowledge for advertisers.

I also try to estimate the value of user feedback as a regulatory signal in online service matching platforms using data from China’s online ride-hailing industry. Unfortunately, the businesses we work with did not survive [Covid-19](https://covid19.who.int/region/wpro/country/cn).



## My Professional Experience
I've also interned at two leading quantitative hedge funds in China ([Jiaqi](https://www.lingjuninvest.com/?lang=en-us) and [Lingjun](https://www.lingjuninvest.com/?lang=en-us)), I think it's quite safe to say they are the best quant trading team in China. I enjoy working on challenging algorithm design tasks in this industry. Here, in addition to developing high-performance high-frequency trading algorithms, I was responsible for researches about basic feature extraction and factor mining. These roles significantly enhanced my algorithmic capabilities and understanding of advanced math tools. I also worked in [CICC](https://cgi.cicc.com/zh_CN/home) as an assistant researcher where my role is quite trivial. But we successfully predicted the epidemic prevention and control and vaccine policies of the UK and China at that time~ 

When my research tasks become less challenging, I seek out opportunities in the industry. This isn't because I dislike academia, but rather to apply my skills in practical, real-world settings and gain fresh insights and inspiration. I LOVE [ACADEMIA](https://www.aeaweb.org/).

## Future Research Plan
Looking to the future, I want to extend the research frontier of information economics in the context of digital platforms, both empirically and theoretically. Digital economy is fast-changing featuring in recent years the wide applications of artificial intelligence based on nano level data. It not only changed how service is provided but also generate new forms of human computer interactions, which challenges the applicability of classic economic theories about market, labor, and industrial organization. There are exciting new research questions including the principal-agent problem in the platform economy and the dynamic learning strategy under reinforcement learning algorithms, for example to evaluate the value of consumers’ feedback since they act as a supervision role in platform economy, and so on. Some new technologies, such as blockchain technology, may even fundamentally change trust-building mechanism in microeconomic theory. I intend to put my effort into understanding such phenomena and building new theories.
