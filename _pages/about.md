I am an undergraduate student at the [National School of Development, Peking University](https://en.nsd.pku.edu.cn/). I was born in [Suizhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suizhou) and speak Chinese and English.

## My research
I work on microeconomic theory, with a particular interest in robust mechanism design, information disclosure, and decision theory.
## My values
I find it beautiful when economics models have some philosophical insights about uncertainty. 
- I like mathematics,
- My favorite writer is [Leo Tolstoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy),
- My favorite historian is [Tony Judt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Judt),
- I like short, simple papers that are to the point.
- My favorite quote is:" One should be light like a bird, and not like a feather."

I also like reading, cycling, and cooking, although I am not particularly good at those.
