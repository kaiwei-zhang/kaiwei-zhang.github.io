I am currently a Ph.D. student at [Economics Department, Penn State University](https://econ.la.psu.edu/). I graduate from [Yuanpei College, Peking University](https://yuanpei.pku.edu.cn/en/) and got a master's degree in [Guanghua School of Management, Peking University](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/). I was born in [Pingyao, Shanxi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingyao) and speak Chinese and English.

## My research
I mainly work on applied microeconomic theory, with a particular interest in dynamic learning and tournament design. I'm also interested in behavior topics. For example, I have a working paper which introduces Expectations-Based Loss Aversion into Subjective Tournament Design. More details can be found in my working papers!

I'm also trying to include information technology like [bandit algo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit) or [platform economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_economy) into my study. I have some research projects with respect to supervision problems in platform economy and ad-experiments in digital economy. Specifically, I spent two years in 
[JD.com.INC](https://www.jd.com/?country=USA) as an algorithem scientist intern where I previously developed a functioning bandit system. It dynamically allocates user traffic to the temporarily optimal materials while ensuring convergence speed through continuous learning. Additionally, leveraging the extensive data obtained, I constructed a causal analysis economic model to assess the effectiveness of the experimental platform. We also examined whether advertisers could transfer the knowledge gained.

I've also interned at two leading quantitative hedge funds in China ([Jiaqi](https://www.lingjuninvest.com/?lang=en-us) and [Lingjun](https://www.lingjuninvest.com/?lang=en-us)). Here, in addition to developing high-performance high-frequency trading algorithms, I was responsible for researches about basic feature extraction and factor mining. These roles significantly enhanced my algorithmic capabilities and understanding of advanced math tools. 

Looking to the future, I want to extend the research frontier of information economics in the context of digital platforms, both empirically and theoretically. Digital economy is fast-changing featuring in recent years the wide applications of artificial intelligence based on nano level data. It not only changed how service is provided but also generate new forms of human computer interactions, which challenges the applicability of classic economic theories about market, labor, and industrial organization. There are exciting new research questions including the principal-agent problem in the platform economy and the dynamic learning strategy under reinforcement learning algorithms, for example to evaluate the value of consumersâ€™ feedback since they act as a supervision role in platform economy, and so on. Some new technologies, such as blockchain technology, may even fundamentally change trust-building mechanism in microeconomic theory. I intend to put my effort into understanding such phenomena and building new theories.
