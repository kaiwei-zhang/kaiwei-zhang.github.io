I have written several papers (Tanaka & Toda, [2013](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2012.12.020), [2015](http://doi.org/10.1137/140971269);) on discretizing probability distributions and stochastic processes.
I have compiled the discretization codes in a Matlab package.
The things you can achieve with this package are the followings:

    Discretize a VAR(1) with Gaussian shocks
    Discretize an AR(p) process with Gaussian mixture shocks
    Discretize an AR(1) with log AR(1) stochastic volatility
    Discretize the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model
    Calibrate a discrete distribution directly from data

The package also contains a tutorial on how to write your own discretization codes.
If you find any bugs or you have other processes that you would like to be discretized, please let me know by email.
