\\(\LaTeX\\) is "the" standard document preparation system in economics and finance (and many other fields that are math-intensive, such as mathematics, physics, computer science, statistics, etc.).  Nowadays writing a paper without using \\(\LaTeX\\) will signal that your research is not serious, so all Ph.D. students seeking academic jobs should learn how to use \\(\LaTeX\\) at an early stage.  (A good commitment device is to typeset all homework assignments with \\(\LaTeX\\).)  The fixed cost of learning is high, but the marginal cost of creating complex documents is really low!  Since there are abundant online resources on \\(\LaTeX\\), I will list only a few links that I feel particularly useful.
