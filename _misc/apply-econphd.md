An economics professor is one of the best jobs. You have plenty of free time to do fun things (research), but unlike other scientific fields, economics professors get paid well. (If you like money, then being a business school professor or working in the industry may be better, but then you might have to spend a lot of time on unpleasant things.)

To become an economics professor, you need an economics Ph.D. There are already plenty of advices on applying to economics Ph.D. programs out there, so I will be brief. In my opinion, the most important things are
1. Letter of recommendation,
1. Mathematics,
1. Relevant research experience.
Below, I discuss these points in a bit more detail. My advice is aimed at Top 10-20 programs (since UCSD is such).

## Letter of recommendation
What you need are informative and credible letters of recommendation.
