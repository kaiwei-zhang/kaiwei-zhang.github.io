We are all busy. As for me, I teach multiple classes, I do research, I take care of my family, and I would like to have some time for leisure such as playing tennis in addition to eating and sleeping. Let's say I am teaching 200 students in a quarter (10 weeks) and each student asks me a question by email *once* per quarter. Then on average I would receive 20 emails per week. Because answering questions by email oftentimes requires multiple exchanges, the number of emails I would have to write (and the amount of time I would have to spend doing so) becomes substantial. Personally, I feel bad when I fail to answer a personal email, so even if I choose not to reply to some emails, I feel significant stress for dealing with emails.

So please help make my life easier by following some simple tips.
1. I prefer to be called "Prof. Toda" by undergraduate students. "Hey Prof.", "Hi Alexis", etc. are not acceptable. I will not answer to such emails. (On the other hand, "Hi Alexis" is acceptable and even encouraged for PhD students.)
1. If you have a question about a course, you should mention which course you are taking because I might be teaching multiple courses during a quarter.
1. I cannot answer to questions about the grade until after the final exam because I do not know what your grade will be until after the final exam.
1. Many questions can be resolved by simple Google searches. Think twice before asking a question.
1. Important information is often included in the syllabus. Do not send me emails before thoroughly reading the syllabus.
1. For questions related to course materials, please ask questions in person during classes or office hours.

According to my experience, the majority emails sent from undergraduate students are unnecessary. Examples are
- "When is the exam?" (Please read the syllabus.)
- "Will the exam score be curved?" (Please read the syllabus.)
- "I don't understand the derivation of such-and-such" (I am happy to explain in person.)
- "Do you think such-and-such is a good investment?" (I have no idea and that's not my problem.)

Legitimate emails include, for example,
- "I would like to apply for a grad school and can you write me a letter of recommendation?" (I am happy to deal with that, but please read [my letter of recommendation policy](https://alexisakira.github.io/misc/letter-of-recommendation) first.)
- "I missed (am going to miss) an exam for such-and-such (university-approved) reason. What should I do?" (Please submit evidence that support your claim if you missed a midterm. If you miss a final, you fail the course [per university policy](https://senate.ucsd.edu/operating-procedures/educational-policies/courses/epc-policies-on-courses/policy-exams-including-midterms-final-exams-and-religious-accommodations-for-exams/).)
